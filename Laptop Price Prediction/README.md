# Laptop Price Prediction

Welcome to the Laptop Price Prediction project! This project aims to develop a machine learning model that can predict the prices of laptops based on various features.
##
In this project, we leverage a dataset containing information about various laptops, including specifications such as RAM size, storage capacity, screen size, and more. By applying machine learning techniques, we aim to build a robust predictive model that can estimate the price of a laptop given its specifications.
