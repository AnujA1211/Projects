# Drug Classification Project
Welcome to the Drug Classification project! This project focuses on predicting the appropriate drug for patients based on their demographic and health-related features. Leveraging machine learning techniques, we aim to build a model that can assist healthcare professionals in prescribing the most suitable medication for individuals.

In this project, we use a dataset containing information such as age, sex, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and the sodium-to-potassium ratio (Na_to_k) for a group of patients. By employing classification algorithms, we seek to create a predictive model that categorizes patients into different drug classes.
